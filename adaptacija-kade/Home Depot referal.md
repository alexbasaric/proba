Hello Alex 

It's Antonio Bellusci from Home Depot’s Renovations

We do full and part interior renovations and much more than just bathrooms and kitchens - see video links below.

We can discuss your project over the phone and plan next steps 

We have availability to start new projects in weeks to come 

Do you have any images of the space you would like to renovate - please email images to Antonio@CeraStoneltd.com or you can text images to my cell phone 416-537-2060

Materials for your new project can be sourced from Home Depot and from other stores

Home Depot has a great finance offer with monthly payments and interest deferral
